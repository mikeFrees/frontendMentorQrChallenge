## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Font importation
- Media queries

### What I learned

I got a better understanding of CSS and feel more comfortable with the language. After a lot of theory i feel like i am learning more by doing these exercices.

### Continued development

I need to get a better grasp on the working of flexbox. And develop a habit of designing mobile first.
